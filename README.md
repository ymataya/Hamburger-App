# Hamburger App

## Project Description:

## Installation:
* Express
* Express Handlebars
* MySQL

## Usage:
The user is first presented with a list of burgers that were previously added. Then, the user is able to add to the list of burgers. The user can also re-arrange the burgers by putting a burger(s) in the "eaten" column by clicking on the "eat" button OR remove burgers from each column by clicking on the "remove" button.
